    "### Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the statistical world, a hypothesis is an assumption about a __population parameter__. Examples of hypotheses (that’s plural for hypothesis) include the following:\n",
    "- The average adult drinks 1.7 cups of coffee per day.\n",
    "- Twelve percent of undergraduate students will go directly to graduate school after graduation.\n",
    "- No more than 2 percent of our products sold to customers are defective\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, we have made a statement about the population that may or may not be true. The purpose of hypothesis testing is to make a statistical conclusion about accepting or not accepting such statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by having a null hypothesis $H_0$ which represents the status quo, that is the population is not affected by whatever intervention applied. The alternate hypothesis $H_1$ is to denote that there is an effect on the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualise the procedure as follows:\n",
    "- Collect a sample of size n, and calculate the test statistic, which in this case is the sample mean.\n",
    "- Plot the sample mean on the x-axis of the sampling distribution curve.\n",
    "- If the sample mean falls within the white region, we do not reject $H_0$. That is, we do not have enough evidence to support $H_1$, the alternative hypothesis, which states that the population mean is not equal to 6.0 days.\n",
    "- If the sample mean falls in either shaded region, otherwise known as the rejection region, we reject $H_0$. That is, we have enough evidence to support $H_1$, which results in our belief that the true population mean is not equal to 6.0 day\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are two rejection regions in this figure, we have a two-tail hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may have a null hypothesis as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0:\\mu=6.0 days$$\n",
    "$$H_1:\\mu\\ne6.0 days$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean number of days for a medical suture to dissolve. We invented a new suture, and want to test if there is a differences in the days it will take to dissolve. For the new suture, we found the mean to be 6.1 days. Is the new suture able to dissovle faster than the normal sutures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say that I know that the standard deviation of the population, $\\sigma$, is 0.5 days, and my sample size to test the hypothesis, n, is 30. We’ll also set $\\alpha$ = 0.05, which means I’m willing to accept a 5 percent chance of committing a Type I error. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the samples are less than 30, we use the t-distribution. If the population standard deviation is unknown we use the sample standard distribution divided by the square root of the sample size. "
